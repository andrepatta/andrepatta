# Hi there 👋

I’m a seasoned software engineer with over 19 years of dynamic experience, deeply specializing in a diverse array of programming languages. My passion for technology sparked at the age of 13 when I first started coding, a journey that quickly escalated as I launched my own business by the age of 14. This early immersion laid a strong foundation for my innovative mindset and entrepreneurial spirit. In early 2017, my curiosity and fascination with decentralization guided me into the world of blockchain technology, where I have remained captivated by its transformative potential. 

Believing that a true master of software development is proficient in any programming language, I approach each project with versatility, adaptability, and a relentless drive to leverage technology to solve complex problems.
